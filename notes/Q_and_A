Questions and follow-ups:
>>>Did you have time to extract the recent updates from these datasets? I mean data points deposited after 2021 or 2022. That count could help us to reduce the dataset size and would make your job a lot easier.
	Humsavar: Uniprot previous release gunzips all the data into one which is ~140GB in gipped format.
	Clinvar:  #-of rows increased from 2021-12 to 2023-01 in ClinVar according to human genome assembly GRCh38:
		Possibly benign: 424545
		Possibly pathogenic: 50265
		Possibly no clinical significance: 112

>>>Did you find proteins with more than 1000 variants (pathogenic or not) from clinvar?
An example row in clinvar db is as follows. I am not sure how to map this variants of the same protein.

>>>UniProt has a file in its FTP server, which maps gene variants to Protein sequences. The name of the file contains "variants" in it.
I could not find this yet. I found "homo_sapiens_variation.txt.gz" in uniport variants ftp directory.

>>>Gnomad is another widely-used database of variants. Again, it does not report protein sequences.
>>>Another info: There are only a few sources of variant data (experiment projects). The data is stored in multiple databases. Usually, the information flows from DB to another. Clinvar data may overlap with Humsavar, etc. Hence it is important you note down and report the release date of databases.
