Pathogenicity (pathogenic and likely pathogenic) analysis dataset curation:
    
    Downloaded the pathogenic and likely-pathogenic SNVs for humans from NCBI-dbSNP separately:
        "homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "missense variant"[Molecular consequence] AND "clinsig pathogenic"[Filter] AND ("2022/01/01"[Creation Date] : "2023/02/14"[Creation Date]) 
        "homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "missense variant"[Molecular consequence] AND "clinsig likely path"[Filter] AND ("2022/01/01"[Creation Date] : "2023/02/14"[Creation Date]) 

    Map the SNPs with the corresponding canonical transcription protein products using gene2refseq (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/, gene2refseq.gz, 1.3G):

    Run the following, which will essentially cleanup and merge patho and likely-patho set. Outputs will be saved at "models/aa_common/datasets_pathogenicity/".
