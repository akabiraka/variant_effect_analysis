Population frequency based analysis dataset curation:

Downloaded the single nucleotide missense variants (SNVs) for humans from NCBI-dbSNP:
    python data_processing/dbsnp_search_download_parse_save.py
    The query used in this script is:
        "homo sapians"[Organism] AND "missense variant"[Function Class] AND "snp protein"[Filter] AND "by alfa"[Validation Status]  


The to map the SNPs to its corresponding canonical transcription protein products, we use MANE (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/MANE/MANE_human/current/, MANE.GRCh38.v1.0.summary.txt.gz, 1M).
We also tried mapping SNVs based on following gene2refseq (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/, gene2refseq.gz, 1.3G) and  LRG_RefSeqGene (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/RefSeqGene/, LRG_RefSeqGene, 2.4M), however found MANE best. 
From the readme associated with each file, MANE is more appropriate for selecting canonical mRNA transcripts and protein products. 
Then we map the SNVs with ALFA population count dataset (https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/population_frequency/latest_release/, freq.vcf.gz, 11G).

Pathogenicity (pathogenic and likely pathogenic) analysis dataset curation:
    
    Downloaded the pathogenic and likely-pathogenic SNVs for humans from NCBI-dbSNP separately:
        "homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "missense variant"[Molecular consequence] AND "clinsig pathogenic"[Filter] AND ("2022/01/01"[Creation Date] : "2023/02/14"[Creation Date]) 
        "homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "missense variant"[Molecular consequence] AND "clinsig likely path"[Filter] AND ("2022/01/01"[Creation Date] : "2023/02/14"[Creation Date]) 

    Map the SNPs with the corresponding canonical transcription protein products using gene2refseq (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/, gene2refseq.gz, 1.3G):
