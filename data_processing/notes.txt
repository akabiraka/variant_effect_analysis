Population frequency based analysis dataset curation:

Downloaded the single nucleotide missense variants (SNVs) for humans from NCBI-dbSNP:
    python data_processing/dbsnp_search_download_parse_save.py
    The query used in this script is:
        "homo sapians"[Organism] AND "missense variant"[Function Class] AND "snp protein"[Filter] AND "by alfa"[Validation Status]

The to map the SNPs to its corresponding canonical transcription protein products, we use MANE (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/MANE/MANE_human/current/, MANE.GRCh38.v1.0.summary.txt.gz, 1M).
We also tried mapping SNVs based on following gene2refseq (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/, gene2refseq.gz, 1.3G) and  LRG_RefSeqGene (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/RefSeqGene/, LRG_RefSeqGene, 2.4M), however found MANE best. 
From the readme associated with each file, MANE is more appropriate for selecting canonical mRNA transcripts and protein products. 
Then we map the SNVs with ALFA population count dataset (https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/population_frequency/latest_release/, freq.vcf.gz, 11G).
