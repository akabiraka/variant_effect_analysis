    Java search program pdf: It is in the downloaded zip named search_dbNSFP43a.readme.pdf. An online copy for 4.1a can be found here https://zenodo.org/record/4323592#.Y_D-yIDMKMJ
    Unzip:
        mv data/dbnsfp/9r6iamhldji4c3vodwebh3947vgrvsng data/dbnsfp/dbNSFP4.3a.zip
        unzip data/dbnsfp/dbNSFP4.3a.zip -d data/dbnsfp/dbNSFP43a/

### Workflow:
	python models/dbnsfp/data_preprocess.py
	sbatch models/dbnsfp/hopper.sh

### Run the program:
    An example with 3 SNPs: java -cp data/dbnsfp/dbNSFP43a/ search_dbNSFP43a -i models/dbnsfp/inputs/sample_query_hg38.txt -o models/dbnsfp/outputs/sample_query_hg38.out -w 1-6,77-79,85-86,91-92,94-96,124-125

    sbatch models/dbnsfp/hopper.sh    


### For population frequency analysis, following three commands need to run.
	python models/aa_common/chromosomal_SNV_conversion_for_population_freq.py
	java -cp data/dbnsfp/dbNSFP43a/ search_dbNSFP43a -i models/aa_common/datasets_population_freq/chromosomal_SNVs_without_population_freq_small.txt -o models/dbnsfp/outputs/chromosomal_SNVs_preds.out -w 1-6,77-79,90-91
	python models/dbnsfp/analysis_population_freq.py


### The column indices (1-6,77-79,85-86,91-92,94-96,124-125) are from dbNSFP4.3a readme:
1	chr: chromosome number
2	pos(1-based): physical position on the chromosome as to hg38 (1-based coordinate).
		For mitochondrial SNV, this position refers to the rCRS (GenBank: NC_012920). 
3	ref: reference nucleotide allele (as on the + strand)
4	alt: alternative nucleotide allele (as on the + strand)
5	aaref: reference amino acid
		"." if the variant is a splicing site SNP (2bp on each end of an intron)
6	aaalt: alternative amino acid
		"." if the variant is a splicing site SNP (2bp on each end of an intron)



77	MetaRNN_score: Our recurrent neural network (RNN) based ensemble prediction score, which
		incorporated 16 scores (SIFT, Polyphen2_HDIV, Polyphen2_HVAR, MutationAssessor, PROVEAN, 
		VEST4, M-CAP, REVEL, MutPred, MVP, PrimateAI, DEOGEN2, CADD, fathmm-XF, Eigen and GenoCanyon), 
		8 conservation scores (GERP, phyloP100way_vertebrate, phyloP30way_mammalian, 
		phyloP17way_primate, phastCons100way_vertebrate, phastCons30way_mammalian, 
		phastCons17way_primate and SiPhy), and allele frequency information from the 1000 Genomes 
		Project (1000GP), ExAC, and gnomAD. Larger value means the SNV is more likely to be damaging. 
		Scores range from 0 to 1.
78	MetaRNN_rankscore: MetaRNN scores were ranked among all MetaRNN scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore
		is the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of MetaRNN scores in dbNSFP. 
		The scores range from 0 to 1.
79	MetaRNN_pred: Prediction of our MetaRNN based ensemble prediction score,"T(olerated)" or
		"D(amaging)". The score cutoff between "D" and "T" is 0.5. The rankscore cutoff between 
		"D" and "T" is 0.6149.


85	MutPred_score: General MutPred score. Scores range from 0 to 1. The larger the score the more
		likely the SNP has damaging effect.
86	MutPred_rankscore: MutPred scores were ranked among all MutPred scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is
		the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of MutPred scores in dbNSFP.


90	MVP_score: A pathogenicity prediction score for missense variants using deep learning approach.
		The range of MVP score is from 0 to 1. The larger the score, the more likely the variant is 
		pathogenic. The authors suggest thresholds of 0.7 and 0.75 for separating damaging vs tolerant 
		variants in constrained genes (ExAC pLI >=0.5) and non-constrained genes (ExAC pLI<0.5), respectively. 
		Details see doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/259390
		Multiple entries are separated by ";", corresponding to Ensembl_transcriptid.
91	MVP_rankscore: MVP scores were ranked among all MVP scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is
		the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of MVP scores in dbNSFP. 


94	PrimateAI_score: A pathogenicity prediction score for missense variants based on common variants of
		non-human primate species using a deep neural network. The range of PrimateAI score is 0 to 1. 
		The larger the score, the more likely the variant is pathogenic. The authors suggest a threshold
		of 0.803 for separating damaging vs tolerant variants. 
		Details see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0167-z
95	PrimateAI_rankscore: PrimateAI scores were ranked among all PrimateAI scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is
		the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of PrimateAI scores in dbNSFP. 
96	PrimateAI_pred: Prediction of PrimateAI score based on the authors' recommendation, "T(olerated)" or
		"D(amaging)". The score cutoff between "D" and "T" is 0.803.


124	DANN_score: DANN is a functional prediction score retrained based on the training data
		of CADD using deep neural network. Scores range from 0 to 1. A larger number indicate 
		a higher probability to be damaging. More information of this score can be found in
		doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu703. 
125	DANN_rankscore: DANN scores were ranked among all DANN scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is
		the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of DANN scores in dbNSFP.
