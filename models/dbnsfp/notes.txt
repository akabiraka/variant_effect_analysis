		For mitochondrial SNV, this position refers to the rCRS (GenBank: NC_012920). 
3	ref: reference nucleotide allele (as on the + strand)
4	alt: alternative nucleotide allele (as on the + strand)
5	aaref: reference amino acid
		"." if the variant is a splicing site SNP (2bp on each end of an intron)
6	aaalt: alternative amino acid
		"." if the variant is a splicing site SNP (2bp on each end of an intron)


38	SIFT_score: SIFT score (SIFTori). Scores range from 0 to 1. The smaller the score the

		If there are multiple scores, only the most damaging (largest) rankscore is presented.
		The rankscores range from 0.00964 to 0.91255.
40	SIFT_pred: If SIFTori is smaller than 0.05 (rankscore>0.39575) the corresponding nsSNV is

---------------------------------------The following columns are for conservation prediction scores.---------------------------------------

141	integrated_fitCons_score: fitCons score predicts the fraction of genomic positions belonging to
		a specific function class (defined by epigenomic "fingerprint") that are under selective 
		pressure. Scores range from 0 to 1, with a larger score indicating a higher proportion of 
		nucleic sites of the functional class the genomic position belong to are under selective 
		pressure, therefore more likely to be functional important. Integrated (i6) scores are
		integrated across three cell types (GM12878, H1-hESC and HUVEC). More details can be found
		in doi:10.1038/ng.3196.		
162	phyloP17way_primate: a conservation score based on 17way alignment primate set,
		the higher the more conservative. Scores range from -13.362 to 0.756 in dbNSFP.
168	phastCons17way_primate: a conservation score based on 17way alignment primate set,
		The larger the score, the more conserved the site. Scores range from 0 to 1. 
173	bStatistic: Background selection (B) value estimates from doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000471.
		Ranges from 0 to 1000. It estimates the expected fraction (*1000) of neutral diversity present 
		at a site. Values close to 0 represent near complete removal of diversity as a result of 
		background selection and values near 1000 indicating absent of background selection.
