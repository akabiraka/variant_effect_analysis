From preprocessed SNVs with corresponding allele population count and canonical protein transcription, we first computed the allele population frequency.
They we downloaded the corresponding protein sequences from NCBI-Protein (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/) database.
Finally, we combine all the protein sequences into one fasta document.

We further cleanup this dataset by removing SNVs whose mutant allele population count is 0. From the remaining we kept three types of SNVs.
    common
    rare
    sampled-singtons: sampled singletons (mutant allele population count is 1) as equal of common+rare number of SNVs

    Function signature: get_population_freq_SNVs from models/aa_common/data_loader.py.
    This function is used for computing all models predictions for population frequency based analysis.
