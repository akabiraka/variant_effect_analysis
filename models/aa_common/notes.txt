From preprocessed SNVs with corresponding allele population count and canonical protein transcription, we first computed the allele population frequency.
They we downloaded the corresponding protein sequences from NCBI-Protein (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/) database.
Finally, we combine all the protein sequences into one fasta document.
    python models/aa_common/SNVs_conversion_for_popu_freq.py

We further cleanup this dataset by removing SNVs whose mutant allele population count is 0. From the remaining we kept three types of SNVs.
    common
    rare
    sampled-singtons: sampled singletons (mutant allele population count is 1) as equal of common+rare number of SNVs

    Function signature: get_population_freq_SNVs from models/aa_common/data_loader.py.
    This function is used for computing all models predictions for population frequency based analysis.


From preprocessed SNVs for Pathogenicity analysis, we clean the dataset, 
downloaded the corresponding protein sequences from NCBI-Protein (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/) database,
and combined all the protein sequences into one fasta document
    python models/aa_common/SNVs_conversion_for_pathogenicity.py

We compute a neutral dataset from the population frequency dataset to test with the pathogenic (or likely) dataset. 
Based on the query on ncbi clinvar database, we previously got the dataset for pathogenic and likely-pathogenic.
I exclusively made the dataset for pathogenic and likely-pathogenic, so no intersection between them.
Then I sampled variants for neutral SNVs from population-frequency dataset. The sampling criteria are as follows:
      . excluding 0/1 population count variants.
      . from the remaining I sampled the same number of variants as pathogenic (or likely-pathogenic) variants. And these sampled variants are corresponding to the same proteins (genes) as are in the pathogenic (or likely-pathogenic) dataset.
This sampling has been done 10 times.

matplotlib_venn was not installing in hopper_variant_effect_analysis_mine.
From https://www.piwheels.org/project/matplotlib-venn/, matplotlib-venn was not compiled on python3.8.x, so reduce the python version as follows.
from matplotlib_venn import venn3

module load python/3.7.6-iu
python -m venv hopper_py376
source /projects/ashehu/akabir4/venvs/  hopper_py376/bin/activate
