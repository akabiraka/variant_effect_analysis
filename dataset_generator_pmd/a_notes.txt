PMD_dbnsfp.ipynb is what I got from Dr. Praba. This contains scores from dbnsfp.

Here, the raw PMD data is mapped with rs-ids such that we can extract chromosomal variants to compare with.
PMD_merging_with_rsids.ipynb 

Then, we merge the above two set to better cover the PMD data with dbNSFP.
PMD_merging_dbnsfp_and_rsids.ipynb


We do not use SNVs_conversion_for_PMD.ipynb anymore.

dbNSFP extraction and postprocessing:
    models/aa_common/data_preprocess.ipynb (only pmd section).
    models/dbnsfp/hopper.sh 
    models/aa_common/outputs_postprocess_pmd.ipynb
